# Extending the DSL

Extend the Nodestream DSL to create new ways to collect and process data.

## Overview

The Nodestream DSL is a powerful way to define how data is collected and modeled as a graph.
You can extend the DSL to create new ways to collect and process data.
You can either include these customizations an a [plugin](../building-plugins) or as a part of your own codebase.

## Supporting New File Types

As documented in the [File Extractor Family](../../reference/extractors#the-file-extractor-family) section, nodestream supports a variety of file types.
You can add support for new file types by creating a [new extractor](../new-steps#creating-an-extractor) or by extending the existing extractors by introducing a supported file type.
It is best to prefer the latter approach but if you need to create a new extractor, you can read the [Creating a New Extractor](../new-steps#creating-an-extractor) section.
This section will guide you through the process of creating a new file type support.

### Implementing a New File Type

To start, you need to create a new file type handler class.
To do so, subclaas from the `SupportedFileFormat` class and stub the `read_file_from_handle` method.

```python
from nodestream.extractors.files import SupportedFileFormat

class TabbedSeperatedValues(SupportedFileFormat, alias=".tsv"):
    def read_file_from_handle(self, fp) -> Iterable[dict]:
        ...
```

The `read_file_from_handle` method should return an iterable of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row in the file.
The keys of the dictionary should be the column names and the values should be the values in the row.
By default, the `fp` variable is a read handle to the file in `bytes` mode.
Often times, you will want to read the file in text mode, so you can use the `io.TextIOWrapper` class to wrap the file handle in text mode.

```python
from io import TextIOWrapper
from nodestream.extractors.files import SupportedFileFormat

class TabbedSeperatedValues(SupportedFileFormat, alias=".tsv"):
    reader = TextIOWrapper

    def read_file_from_handle(self, text_fp) -> Iterable[dict]:
            for line in text_fp:
                ...
```

In this case, the `reader` attribute is set to `TextIOWrapper` to indicate that the file should be wrapped in a `TextIOWrapper` object.
The `read_file_from_handle` method is now expecting a text file handle and can read the file line by line.
Thus, we can now use the `csv` module to parse the file.

```python
from csv import DictReader
from io import TextIOWrapper

from nodestream.extractors.files import SupportedFileFormat


class TabbedSeperatedValues(SupportedFileFormat, alias=".tsv"):
    reader = TextIOWrapper

    def read_file_from_handle(self, text_fp) -> Iterable[dict]:
        for row in DictReader(text_fp, delimiter="\t"):
            yield row
```

### Registering the New File Type

File types are registered via the [entry_points](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/entry_point.html#entry-points-for-plugins) API of a Python Package.
Specifically, the `entry_point` named `files` inside of the `nodestream.plugins` group is loaded.
The entry point provided should be a module which has atleast one subclass of `nodestream.extractors.files:SupportedFileFormat` as directed above.
Each subclass will be registered as an `SupportedFileFormat`.

Depending on how you are building your package, you can register your audit plugin in one of the following ways:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="pyproject"
  values={[
    {label: 'pyproject.toml', value: 'pyproject'},
    {label: 'poetry', value: 'poetry'},
    {label: 'setup.cfg', value: 'setup-cfg'},
    {label: 'setup.py', value: 'setup-py'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="pyproject">
    ```toml
    [project.entry-points."nodestream.plugins"]
    files = "my_python_package.files"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="poetry">
    ```toml
    [tool.poetry.plugins."nodestream.plugins"]
    files = "my_python_package.files"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="setup-cfg">
    ```ini
    [options.entry_points]
    nodestream.plugins =
        files = my_python_package.files
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="setup-py">
    ```python
    from setuptools import setup

    setup(
        # ...,
        entry_points = {
            'nodestream.plugins': [
                'files = nodestream_plugin_cool.files',
            ]
        }
    )
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Using the New File Type

Once the new file type is registered, it can be used in the DSL as a file extractor.
The file extractors will automatically be aware of and use the new file type.

```yaml
- implementation: nodestream.pipeline.extractors:FileExtractor
  arguments:
    globs:
      - data/*.tsv
```

## Creating an Interpretation

The [Interpreations](../../reference/interpreting#interpretations) that are built into nodestream are powerful tools for mapping the data into a graph.
However, you may need to create a new interpretation to handle a specific use case.
This section will guide you through the process of creating a new interpretation.
Before venturing down this path, it is recommended to read the [Interpreting References](../../reference/interpreting) as well as the [Source Node](../../tutorials-intermediate/source-nodes) and [Relationship Building](../../tutorials-intermediate/relationship-building-techniques) tutorials thoroughly to understand the concepts, best practices, and the existing interpretations.

### Implementing a New Interpretation

To start, you need to create a new interpretation class.
To do so, subclass from the `Interpretation` class and stub the `interpret` method.

```python
from nodestream.interpreting import Interpretation
from nodestream.pipeline.value_providers import ProviderContext


class MyInterpretation(Interpretation):
     def interpret(self, context: ProviderContext):
        ...
```

The `interpret` method should use the `context` object to create nodes and relationships in the graph.
The `context` object has methods for creating nodes and relationships, as well as methods for querying the graph and the underlying data being interpreted.

For example, let's say we want to store the positive and negative values of a boolean property in the graph.

For example, if we want to have a `live` and `archived` node `Posts`, we can create a new interpretation to handle this.

```python
from nodestream.interpreting import Interpretation
from nodestream.pipeline.value_providers import ProviderContext, StaticValueOrValueProvider, ValueProvider


class PositiveNegativeProperty(Interpretation, alias="pos_negative"):
    def __init__(self, positive_property_name: str, negative_property_name: str, value: StaticValueOrValueProvider):
        self.positive_property_name = positive_property_name
        self.negative_property_name = negative_property_name
        self.value = ValueProvider.guarantee_value_provider(value)

    def interpret(self, context: ProviderContext):
        source_node = context.desired_ingest.source
        value = self.value.single_value(context)
        source_node.properties.set(self.positive_property_name, value)
        source_node.properties.set(self.negative_property_name, not value)
```

There is a lot there, so lets break it down.
First, we have the `__init__` method which takes in the `positive_property_name`, `negative_property_name`, and `value` arguments.
These values are directly passed from the Yaml location.
The `value` argument is wrapped in a `ValueProvider` to ensure that it is a `ValueProvider` object and not a static value.

The `interpret` method is where the magic happens.
The `context` object is used to get the source node and set the properties on the node.
Then `value` is retrieved from the `value` argument and set on the source node as the `positive_property_name`.
Then `not value` is set on the source node as the `negative_property_name`.

### Registering the New Interpretation


Interpretations are registered via the [entry_points](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/entry_point.html#entry-points-for-plugins) API of a Python Package.
Specifically, the `entry_point` named `interpretations` inside of the `nodestream.plugins` group is loaded.
The entry point provided should be a module which has atleast one subclass of `nodestream.interpreting:Interpretation` as directed above.
Each subclass will be registered as an `Interpretation`.

Depending on how you are building your package, you can register your audit plugin in one of the following ways:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="pyproject"
  values={[
    {label: 'pyproject.toml', value: 'pyproject'},
    {label: 'poetry', value: 'poetry'},
    {label: 'setup.cfg', value: 'setup-cfg'},
    {label: 'setup.py', value: 'setup-py'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="pyproject">
    ```toml
    [project.entry-points."nodestream.plugins"]
    interpretations = "my_python_package.interpretations"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="poetry">
    ```toml
    [tool.poetry.plugins."nodestream.plugins"]
    interpretations = "my_python_package.interpretations"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="setup-cfg">
    ```ini
    [options.entry_points]
    nodestream.plugins =
        interpretations = my_python_package.interpretations
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="setup-py">
    ```python
    from setuptools import setup

    setup(
        # ...,
        entry_points = {
            'nodestream.plugins': [
                'interpretations = nodestream_plugin_cool.interpretations',
            ]
        }
    )
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Using an Interpretation

Once the new interpretation is registered, it can be used in the DSL as an interpretation.
The interpretations will automatically be aware of and use the new interpretation.

```yaml
-  type: pos_negative
   positive_property_name: live
   negative_property_name: archived
   value: true
```


## Creating a Value Provider

### Implementing a New Value Provider

### Registering the New Value Provider

### Using a Value Provider


## Creating a Normalizer

A `Normalizer` allows you to clean data extracted by a `ValueProvider`. They are intended to provided stateless, simple
transformations of data. Nodestream has some built in ones that you can view [here](../../reference/interpreting#normalizers).

For example, assume that you have numeric numbers that should be rounded to a whole number before being used.
Let's build a normalizer that does this for us.

### Implementing a New Normalizer

To start, you need to create a new normalizer class.
To do so, subclass from the `Normalizer` class and stub the `normalize` method.


```python
from typing import Any

from nodestream.pipeline.normalizers import Normalizer

class RoundToWholeNumber(Normalizer, alias="round_numbers"):
    def normalize_value(self, value: Any) -> Any:
        return int(value) if isinstance(value, float) else value
```

In this example, we take a value and round it to a whole number if it is a float.
If it is not a float, we return the value as is.

### Registering the New Normalizer

Normalizers are registered via the [entry_points](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/entry_point.html#entry-points-for-plugins) API of a Python Package. Specifically, the `entry_point` named `normalizers` inside of the `nodestream.plugins` group is loaded. Every Value Provider is expected to be a subclass of `nodestream.pipeline.normalizers:Normalizer` as directed above.

The `entry_point` should be a module that contains at least one `Normalizer` class. At runtime, the module will be loaded and all classes that inherit from `nodestream.pipeline.normalizers:Normalizer` will be registered.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="pyproject"
  values={[
    {label: 'pyproject.toml', value: 'pyproject'},
    {label: 'poetry', value: 'poetry'},
    {label: 'setup.cfg', value: 'setup-cfg'},
    {label: 'setup.py', value: 'setup-py'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="pyproject">
    ```toml
    [project.entry-points."nodestream.plugins"]
    normalizers = "my_python_package.normalizers"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="poetry">
    ```toml
    [tool.poetry.plugins."nodestream.plugins"]
    normalizers = "my_python_package.normalizers"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="setup-cfg">
    ```ini
    [options.entry_points]
    nodestream.plugins =
        normalizers = my_python_package.normalizers
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="setup-py">
    ```python
    from setuptools import setup

    setup(
        # ...,
        entry_points = {
            'nodestream.plugins': [
                'normalizers = nodestream_plugin_cool.normalizers',
            ]
        }
    )
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Using a Normalizer

You can now use your normalizer in sections that handle normalization flags. For more information,
see the [Interpretation's reference](../../reference/interpreting). For example, if you are using this
in a source node interpretation, you could use it as follows:

```yaml
interpretations:
  - type: source_node
    node_type: Metric
    key:
      value: !jmespath value
    normalization:
      do_round_numbers: true
```

## Creating an Argument Resolver

A ArgumentResolver allows you to inline a value into the Pipeline or project file before the pipeline is initialized.
For more information, see the [Configuring Projects and Pipelines](../../tutorials-intermediate/configuring-projects).
This can be useful for passing configuration from files, environment, secret stores, and the like.

### Implementing a New Argument Resolver

Definfing a new argument resolver is simple. You need to subclass from the `ArgumentResolver` class and implement the `resolve_arugment` method.
For example, let's create an argument resolver that retrieves a secret from [amazon's secret manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/).

```python
import boto3

from nodestream.pipeline.argument_resolvers import ArgumentResolver


class SecretResolver(ArgumentResolver, alias="secret"):
    @staticmethod
    def resolve_argument(variable_name):
        client = boto3.client("secretsmanager")
        return client.get_secret_value(SecretId=variable_name)["SecretString"]
```

### Registering the New Argument Resolver

ArgumentResolvers are registered via the [entry_points](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/entry_point.html#entry-points-for-plugins) API of a Python Package. Specifically, the `entry_point` named `argument_resolvers` inside of the `nodestream.plugins` group is loaded. It is expected to be a subclass of `nodestream.pipeline.argument_resolvers:ArgumentResolver` as directed above.

The `entry_point` should be a module that contains at least one argument resolver class. At runtime, the module will be loaded and all classes that inherit from `nodestream.pipeline.argument_resolvers:ArgumentResolver` will be registered.

  ]}>
  <TabItem value="pyproject">

    ```

    [options.entry_points]
    nodestream.plugins =
        argument_resolvers = my_python_package.argument_resolvers
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="setup-py">
    ```python
    from setuptools import setup

    setup(
        # ...,
        entry_points = {
            'nodestream.plugins': [
                'argument_resolvers = nodestream_plugin_cool.argument_resolvers',
            ]
        }
    )
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Using an Argument Resolver

You can now use your argument resolver in sections that handle argument resolution. For more information, see the [Configuring Projects and Pipelines](../../tutorials-intermediate/configuring-projects). For example, if you are using this in a pipeline file, you could use it as follows:

```yaml
arguments:
  - name: !secret my_secret_key_in_secrets_manager
```
