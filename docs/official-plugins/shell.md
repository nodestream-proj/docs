## Introduction

The shell plugin allows you to run shell commands as part of your nodestream pipeline.
From the results of the shell command, you can then use the output to process further in the pipeline.

## Maturity

This plugin is currently in **STABLE** and should be fine for production use.

## Pre-requisites

Currently, there are no major pre-requisites for this plugin.

## Features

Currently this plugin features to run shell commands with the following features:

- [x] Run shell commands
- [x] Use the output of the shell command in the pipeline

## Installation

To install the shell plugin, run the following command:

```bash
pip install nodestream-plugin-shell
```

## Configuration

No configuration is needed for this plugin outside of its usage in the pipeline.

## Usage

### Extracting JSON from a shell command

```yaml
- implementation: nodestream_plugin_shell:Shell
  arguments:
    command: curl
    arguments:
      - https://example.com/api/data/json
    options: 
      X: GET
      header: "Accept: application/json"
    ignore_stdout: false #Provide json output from command to next step in pipeline.
```

This is roughly equivalent to the following shell command:

```bash
curl https://example.com/api/data.json -X GET --header "Accept: application/json"
```

### Reading Files that are generated by the shell command

```yaml
- implementation: nodestream_plugin_shell:Shell
  arguments:
    command: curl
    arguments:
      - https://example.com/api/data.json
    options: 
      X: GET
      header: "Accept: application/json"
    flags: 
      - O
    ignore_stdout: true #Do not provide output from command to next step in pipeline.

- implementation: nodestream.pipeline.extractors.files:FileExtractor
  arguments:
    sources:
      - type: local
        globs:
        - data.json
```

This is roughly equivalent to the following shell command:

```bash
curl https://example.com/api/data.json -X GET --header "Accept: application/json" -O
cat data.json
```
